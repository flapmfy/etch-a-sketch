# etch-a-sketch

## Description
This project represents a browser version of something between sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch. This whole 'exercise' is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). 

## Goals
My personal goal is to follow [the assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) and be as accurate as possible. Through this exercise I want to develop my DOM manipulation and problem solving skills. I will mainly focus on the functionality and visuals of the website. I will also try to follow some principles of a clean, maintainable and readable code.
